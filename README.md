Sume Launcher is a launcher app designed for E-ink Readers running Android OS. Its name comes from latin sumere, which means "take", and can be extended to "acquire", corresponding to the aim of reading: acquiring knowledge. 

This app is dedicated to satisfy fundamental requirements while being as smooth as possible. 
1. In regard to the common problem of performance existing among E-ink Readers, this app used ViewPager2 instead of traditional GridLayout to realize the page of apps. It is capable to collect garbage. For those devices which have a great amount of applications installed, it is able to collect the pages which are not used at the moment to ensure smoothness and low memory usage. 
2. Some E-ink Readers provide PageUp and PageDown keys to switch pages. This app has adapted to switch pages by using them.
3. For the devices which have status_bar_height set to 0 and status bar hidden, this app provides a simple simulated status bar. You can view the status of time, WiFi and Bluetooth.

Hope this app brings you good using experience. Any feedbacks and suggestions in Issue are welcomed and appreciated.


秀墨启动器是一个为运行Android操作系统的电纸书阅读器设计的桌面应用程序。它的名字来源于拉丁语sumere，意为“拿”，引申为“获取”，对应于阅读的目的：获取知识。

此应用力图在满足基础需求的同时尽可能提升流畅度。
1. 针对电纸书普遍存在的性能问题，此应用使用ViewPager2而非传统GridLayout实现应用程序页面。它具有垃圾回收功能，对于安装了较多应用、需要多个页面显示应用程序的设备，能够自动回收暂时不需要的页面，保证流畅性和较低的内存占用。
2. 部分电纸书具有翻页按键。此应用已适配通过这些按键翻页的功能。
3. 对于部分设备将status_bar_height设为0、导致状态栏被隐藏的问题，此应用提供了一个简单的模拟状态栏。您可以查看时间、WiFi和蓝牙的状态。

希望此应用能带给您良好的使用体验。欢迎在Issue中反馈问题、提出意见和建议。在此不胜感激。
