Sume Launcher is a launcher app designed for E-ink Readers running Android OS. Its name comes from sumere, which means "take". Reading is a good way to acquire knowledge, and I hope this app will guide you to apps through which you can accomplish this goal.
Nowadays, people use E-ink Readers to obtain information in a more eyes-friendly way. However, productors of this kind of device may tighten restrictions of installing apps or managing settings due to the aim to promote their own online book vending business and reducing cost of repairing to the lowest as they can. Furthermore, their ability of developing may be quite poor so that the systems, especially the build-in launcher apps of their products are very hard to use. This app was developed for the purpose of breaking down limitations set by these productors and managing installed apps and settings easily.
Any feedbacks and suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.
